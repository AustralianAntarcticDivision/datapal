# palr

`palr` provides colour palettes for data, based on some well known
remotely sensed data sets for sea ice concentration, sea surface
temperature and chlorophyll-a.

There are four main ways of working with palr palette functions, which
have names like `icePal`, `chlPal` and `sstPal` for ice, chlorophyll-a
and sst respectively and `mk_timePal` for creating a time-mapped palette
function.

  - `icePal(n)` return n colours from the palette
  - `icePal(data)` return the right colour for values in `data`
  - `icePal(palette = TRUE)` returns the entire palette, with colours
    `cols` and intervals `breaks`
  - `tfun <- mk_timePal(datetimes, pal); plot(x, tfun(dt))` match
    date-times to a palette, or palette function.

There is a vignette illustrating basic usage, this can be read on CRAN
or loaded from within R.

[palr

Run this code to load the vignette within R:

``` r
library(palr)
vignette("palr")
```

This repository holds the *current development version* of the
contributed R-package `palr`.

This development version is more recent than the current *release* of
`palr` on CRAN.

Users of `palr` are encouraged to report bugs and make feature requests
here (click *Issues* in the menu on the right to start a new bug report
or feature request).

Feel free to fork `palr` and make pull requests.

`palr` is a companion package to the data package `raadtools`, but is
not tied to it.

## Installation

Install the current release from CRAN using

``` r
install.packages("palr")
```

The easiest way to install the github version of `palr` is through the
`devtools` package:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("AustralianAntarcticDivision/palr")
```

If you donâ€™t have `devtools` installed you should first run

``` r
install.packages('devtools')
```
